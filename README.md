# cyber-labs

This repository collects my hands-on cybersecurity labs, writeups, and notes.
It is designed as a personal knowledge base to track learning, practice skills, and share experiences across different domains of security.

## Structure

- **sherlocks/** → Digital Forensics, Incident Response (DFIR), and threat intelligence style investigations.
- **pentesting/** → Exploitation, privilege escalation, and offensive security labs.

Each folder contains machine or case writeups, organized with consistent naming conventions for easy navigation.

## Purpose

The goal of this repo is to:
- Document the process and findings from lab exercises.
- Build a reference library for SOC, CTI, IR, and pentesting practices.
- Demonstrate practical skills useful for cybersecurity work.

## Notes

- Sensitive information and live payloads are excluded or sanitized.
- Content is intended for educational and research purposes only.
